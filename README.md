# postgraduate-D79
I'm going to work again tomorrow. I vomit. It's really uncomfortable. I really don't want to go to work. I feel like going to work; It's as hard as purgatory. Is there anything you can do? You can only learn by yourself there. I don't know if this situation will be alleviated in the society in the future. Today, however, the content of SQL is over. Now I start the JDBC chapter, but the previous chapters confuse me. The master-slave replication and MYCAT are really difficult. I don't know whether I can work as a programmer in the future and what I have to study abroad. First of all, I don't speak English. I feel I can't bear the difficulty of the course, I have to write a paper or something. I'm speechless. How can I be so miserable? I have to practice algorithm problems. I really hate algorithm problems, but I can't help it. I have to take the test during the interview. I don't know what to say. I can only brush the questions slowly on leetcode.
